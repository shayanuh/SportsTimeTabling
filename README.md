# SportsTimeTabling
This is the course project for the course :IME 639 We were required to solve the problem statement on sports timetabling from the contest  ITC 2021:International Timetabling Competition on Sports Timetabling.  We solved the problem by Integer programming formulation, and implemented in C++ using CPLEX.  The file description for different folders/files in this folder is shown below:   1)The complete visual studios solution/Project can be found in 'sportstimetabling' 2)Project Report.pdf: This contains introduction ,formulation and complexity analysis  (demonstrated in class) 3)problem_statement.pdf:contains the complete and detailed problem description along with file format guidelines 4)Source.cpp: main cpp file contains the complete code ,(also present in sportstimetabling) 5)Test Input files: contains some test instances(in xml) taken directly from competition site: https://www.sportscheduling.ugent.be/ITC2021/instances.php 6)Test Output files* :contains solution output to Test input files in xml format 7)Explanation for break constraints.txt:Explains the formulation &amp;implementation of break constraints which is non intuitive  The best LB and Best UB for the test instances can be found at : https://www.sportscheduling.ugent.be/ITC2021/instances.php  The solution file can be validated from : https://www.sportscheduling.ugent.be/ITC2021/validator.php  All the files satisfies the best LB i.e. produces optimal solution ,and are validated from above,
